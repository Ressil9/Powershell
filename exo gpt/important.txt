Context : We want to load data from See4C toward Splunk. We aim for a solution that behaves as close as possible to real-time monitoring.

We will use PowerShell throughout the project because it is both efficient and familiar to us.



We've got three cases : 

Case 1 : 

1 : PowerShell requests the latest timestamp stored in Splunk.
2 : Splunk returns the last recorded timestamp.
3 : We use the timestamp as a parameter of the "call API" by using the protocol OData, the data in a JSON format
4 : PowerShell receives the data returned by the API.
5 : PowerShell checks whether the amount of data received can be loaded in a single batch into Splunk. If yes, continue.
6 : The final transformed dataset is sent to Splunk.


Case 2 : 

1 : //
2 : //
3 : //
4 : //
5 : PowerShell determines that the amount of data is too large to be loaded at once
6 : PowerShell sends a partial batch of data to Splunk.
8 : The process iterates until all data has been successfully transferred.

Case 3 :

1 : //
2 : //
3 : //
4 : The API call fails → Error code: See4C API unreachable.
